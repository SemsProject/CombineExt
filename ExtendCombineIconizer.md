Extend the Iconizer to provide icons for further Formats 
=========================================================
The /CombineIconizer maintains a list of icon collections which provide icons for certain file formatas, see ```List<IconCollection> iconCollectionsList``` in /src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/Iconizer.java​​ 


Extending the List of Icon Collections 
---------------------------------------
* to extend the Iconizer you can simply pass another recognizer to the method ```Iconizer.addIconCollection (IconCollection collection)```
* every icon collection needs to extend the ```IconCollection``` class, see /src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/IconCollection.java
* there is a default icon collection, see /src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/collections/DefaultIconCollection.java
* every icon collection has a **priority**
* the default icon collection has a priority of 100:
 * if you want your icon collection to be asked first give it a higher priority
* you can remove all icon collections using ```Iconizer.removeCollections ()```
* you can add the default icon collection using ```Iconizer.addDefaultCollection ()```

Extending the !IconCollection class 
------------------------------------
The abstract class has 4 functions that you need to implement:

* ```int getPriority ()``` must return a positive priority. Default icon collections have a priority of 100. Icon collections with a higher priority are asked first for an icon. The first who provides an icon given a format wins this competition.
* ```URL formatToIconUrl (URI format)``` you'll get a format and you're asked to return the URL to an icon
* ```InputStream formatToIconStream (URI format)``` you'll get a format and you're asked to return a stream delivering the icon
* ```String formatToIconName (URI format)``` you'll get a format and you're asked to return the icon's name. That's useful if the client has the icons somewhere else unpacked (e.g. for web servers etc.)


* The format will always be an URI and should be an *identifiers.org* URL, or, if that does not exist, a *purl.org* url.
* If you can't identify a format unambiguously you should return ```null``` and the next icon collection will be asked

An example of an extension can be found at http://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/combine-ext-pharmml/wiki//src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/pharmml/PharmMlIcon.java
There the Iconizer was extended to also deliver a PharmML icon.
