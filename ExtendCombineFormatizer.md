Extend the Formatizer to Recognize further Types of Files 
==========================================================

The CombineFormatizer maintains a list of recognizers which are able to recognize certain file types, see `List<FormatRecognizer> recognizerList` in /src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/Formatizer.java

Extending the List of Recognizers 
----------------------------------

* to extend the Formatizer you can simply pass another recognizer to the method `Formatizer.addFormatRecognizer (FormatRecognizer recognizer)`
* every Recognizer needs to extend the `FormatRecognizer` class, see /src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/FormatRecognizer.java
* there are a few recognizers added by default, see /src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/recognizer
 * [BioPaxRecognizer](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineExt/blob/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/recognizer/BioPaxRecognizer.java) is able to recognize BioPax files
 * [CellMlRecognizer](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineExt/blob/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/recognizer/CellMlRecognizer.java) is able to recognize CellML files
 * [SbgnRecognizer](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineExt/blob/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/recognizer/SbgnRecognizer.java) is able to recognize SBGN files
 * [SbmlRecognizer](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineExt/blob/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/recognizer/SbmlRecognizer.java) is able to recognize SBML files
 * [SbolRecognizer](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineExt/blob/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/recognizer/SbolRecognizer.java) is able to recognize SBOL files
 * [SedMlRecognizer](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineExt/blob/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/recognizer/SedMlRecognizer.java) is able to recognize SED-ML files
 * [DefaultRecognizer](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineExt/blob/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/recognizer/DefaultRecognizer.java) is a fallback to recognize files by there mime type or extension
* every recognizer has a **priority**
* the default reconizer has a priority of 100:
 * if you want your recognizer to be asked first give it a higher priority
 * the priorities of recognizers shipped with this library 
 * you can change the priority of a recognizer, for example if you know that there are mainly SBML files in your project:
  * `SbmlRecognizer.priority = 200`
  * afterwards you **must** resort the recognizers of the Formatizer using `Formatizer.resortRecognizers ()`
* you can remove all recognizers using `Formatizer.removeRecognizers ()`
* you can add all default recognizers using `Formatizer.addDefaultRecognizers ()`

Extending the !FormatRecognizer class 
--------------------------------------

The abstract class has 4 functions that you need to implement:

* `int getPriority ()` must return a positive priority. Default recognizers have a priority of 100. Recognizers with a higher priority are asked first for a format. The first who knows a format wins this competition.
* `URI getFormatByParsing (File file, String mimeType)` you'll get a files and it's mime type, try to identify it's format by looking into the file
* `URI getFormatFromMime (String mime)` you'll get the mime type of a file, try to identify it's format
* `URI getFormatFromExtension (String extension)` you'll get the extension of a file, try to identify it's format

* The format must always be a URI and should be an *identifiers.org* URL, or, if that does not exist, a *purl.org* url.
* If you can't identify a format unambiguously you should return `null` and the next recognizer will be asked

An example of an extension can be found at [PharmMLRecognizer](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineExt-PharmMl)
There the Formatizer was extended to also recognize PharmML files.
