The CombineIconizer contains methods to get icons for certain file types. It is especially useful for [combinearchive-gui:wiki web interfaces] or [combinearchive-gui:wiki desktop applications].

== About Icons ==
The [source:src/main/resources/icons  icons] are mainly taken from [http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons fatcow]. We extended the pack with the following icons to represent files related to COMBINE standards:

All Icons are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

The icons can be downloaded individually from source:src/main/resources/icons. However, they are also shipped with our `jar` file and you can use them through the CombineIconizer:

== Use Icons ==
The icons can be accessed through two static functions. All you need to provide is a valid format, see CombineFormatizer.

=== Get corresponding Icon Stream ===
You can simply pass a format URL to the `Iconizer.formatToIconStream (URI)` ([http://jdoc.sems.uni-rostock.de/CombineExt/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/Iconizer.html#formatToIconStream(java.net.URI) JavaDoc]) method and you'll receive an `InputStream` containing the icon:

{{{
#!java
URI format = ...
InputStream fin = Iconizer.formatToIconStream (format);
FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream ("/some/file");

byte[] b = new byte[1024];
int noOfBytes = 0;

while ((noOfBytes = fin.read(b)) != -1)
	fout.write (b, 0, noOfBytes);

System.out.println ("File copied!");
fin.close ();
fout.close ();
}}}

This stream can then be used to, for example, store the icon in a different location (as demonstrated in the example above), or to immediately dump the file through an HTTP connection (as it is done in combinearchive-web:wiki).

=== Get corresponding Icon name ===
Of course, always reading the icons from the zipped jar container might be something to avoid. In that case, you may extract the icons and just ask our library for the name of a specific icon. Just pass the format in question to the function `Iconizer.formatToIcon (URI)` ([http://jdoc.sems.uni-rostock.de/CombineExt/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/Iconizer.html#formatToIcon(java.net.URI) JavaDoc]):

{{{
#!java
URI format = ...
String iconName = Iconizer.formatToIcon (format);
// find the icon in:
File iconFile = new File ("/some/dir/" + iconName);
}}}


=== Use Case: Extract and Cache Icons ===
Extracting all icons is a good start to save computational resources. However, we might extend the icon pack at any point in time and, thus, you might miss some icons after an upgrade. Therefore, we consider the following workaround as the best option of using our icons:

* decide for a cache directory `$CACHE`
* ask for the icon name `$ICON`
* test whether `$CACHE/$ICON` already exists and use it if that's the case
* write the icon stream to `$CACHE/$ICON` if it does not exist, yet

For your convenience, some copy&paste-able snippet:


{{{
#!java
String cacheDir = "/tmp/";

URI format = new URI ("http://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sbml");

String iconName = Iconizer.formatToIcon (format);
System.out.println ("icon name: " + iconName);

File expectedFile = new File (cacheDir + iconName);

if (!expectedFile.exists ())
{
	// extract the file
	InputStream fin = Iconizer.formatToIconStream (format);
	FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream (expectedFile);
	
	byte[] b = new byte[1024];
	int noOfBytes = 0;
	
	while ( (noOfBytes = fin.read (b)) != -1)
	{
		fout.write (b, 0, noOfBytes);
	}
	
	System.out.println ("File copied!");
	fin.close ();
	fout.close ();
}
else
{
	// cool. msg just for debugging purposes
	System.out.println ("file extracted previously");
}

// go on using expectedFile!
System.out.println ("icon can be found in "
	+ expectedFile.getAbsolutePath ());
}}}
